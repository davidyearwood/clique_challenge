Challenge:

We would like for you to code up a one-page PSD to get a gauge of your current front-end chops. The page is a  design of our Clique site, and weâ€™re looking to get a sense of languages/libraries and how well you can deliver the original design in code. 

Try not to view the code on the current site except grab any needed images or other assets
Build in HTML, Javascript and CSS with any libraries or build tools you want.
No need to put into Wordpress or worry about responsive
We would like to know how many hours it took you to complete so track them however you'd like. 
Send it back to us anytime in the next week. Let me know if this doesn't work given your schedule.

Let me know if you have any questions!
